# Dark Tidings

![Dark Tidings Logo](https://github.com/AciferBG/Dark-Tidings/blob/main/pics/dark_tidings_logo.png)

**"Don't depend too much on anyone in this world, because even your own shadow leaves you when you are in darkness."**

Far off the coast of Amn lies the isolated island of **Irphong**. Its only notable feature is the **Sea Tower**, a magical lighthouse that marks the northern end of Asavir's Channel and guides sailors through treacherous waters.

For thousands of years, the magical beacon of the Sea Tower of Irphong has burned steadily—until now. The light has gone out, and with it, rumors have returned: Of pirates, Dragon Turtles, Krakens, and older secrets lurking in the dark shallows.

There is only one way to uncover the mystery: **Sail to Irphong** and discover what extinguished the light of the Sea Tower.
